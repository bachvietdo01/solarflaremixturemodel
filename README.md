## About Solar Mixture Model Project

The physics of solar flares on the surface of the Sun is highly complex and not yet fully understood. However, observations show that solar eruptions are associated with the intense kilogauss fields of active regions (ARs), where free energies are stored with field-aligned electric currents. With the advent of high-quality data sources such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), recent works on solar flare forecasting have been focusing on data driven methods. In particular, black box machine learning and deep learning models are increasingly being adopted in which underlying data structures are not modeled explicitly. If the active regions indeed follow the same laws of physics, there should be similar patterns shared among them, reflected by the observations. Yet, these black box models currently used in the space weather literature do not explicitly characterize the heterogeneous nature of the solar flare data, within and between active regions. In this paper, we propose two finite mixture models designed to capture the heterogeneous patterns of active regions and their associated solar flare events. With extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method for both resolving the sample imbalance issue and modeling the heterogeneity for solar flare events, which are strong and rare. This is the GitHub repo for the codes to reproduce the metrics presented in the paper.
